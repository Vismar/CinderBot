## Description
CinderBot is a program that includes many useful and entertaining features for your chat on Twitch.tv. Thanks to this program you can watch the statistics of your stream and each viewer separately in real time, create text rpg, commands, quotes and much more! CinderBot is still at an early stage of development, so everything can change at any time. However, if you decide to use the bot, then starting from version 0.5.5, all the new functionality will not force you to start everything on a new one, as each new version will be released with a look at the previous ones.

If you are interested to know what is planned for the bot in the near future (or even participate in its development), then welcome to the [project page](https://tree.taiga.io/project/vismar-cinderbot/backlog). In addition, in the near future after the release of version 0.5.5, the project wiki will begin to fill with articles, thanks to which it will be easier to understand the project and learn about the finished functionality of the program.
