## Description
This bot was created as a personal project. It starts as "I just want to know how it works", but continues as "I want to publish this app!". It will be a really long way to accomplish it, may be even I will never complete it, or no one will be interested in this bot. But it doesn't bother me much. I keep working on this project because I like it and want to make good application that will not make a shame on me. That all.
P.S. My knowledge of english is not very good, I am apologize for that.
